# collaborative-git-tutorial

A small repo for students to clone to practice reviewing and merging PRs

Students can clone this repo to learn Git and R together.
There are 3 R scripts in the `scripts/` directory.
Each script has a simple data maniputlation operation and a plot.
All scripts also have a misnamed variable to create a bug for students to fix

This works best for groups of 2 or 3 students where each student fixes one file, makes a PR, and reviews the PR of a different student.

There is a guide for students to follow called `collaborative-git-practice.Rmd`.
